# 2024_Fall_NYCU_ICLAB
This course aims to convey the senior and graudated EE students techniques to design the VLSI chips using state-of-the-art CAD tools. In addition to learning CAD tools for performance-driven and cost-effective IC designs, a top-down design flow and related environment will also be addressed. Upon completion of the course, the student will be able to design the integrated circuits and systems based on standard cell library as well as full-custom layout approaches.
